<h2><a href="">Introduction/Disclaimer</a></h2>
<p>This is a personal page, but it is not personal in the sense that I will not write about my personal life.
This is a professional web page, but it is not professional in that it does not represent the view of any professional organization I work or worked for -- this is by no means an institutional web page.
I will be giving my personal opinion or perspective on professional topics, that is, topics related to science (whether it is biology, chemistry, physics, public health), research (whether it is research activity itself, publishing, philosophy of science), programming, experimental design, and it may well be that I end up talking about things I am not trained in (I am not always sure what that is exactly, but see the <a href="https://caesoma.github.io/about/">about</a> page).
This is not a peer-reviewed publication (for those, see <a href="https://caesoma.github.io/publications">publications</a>), and I do not know everything (whatever some people may seem to think, no one does), so some things will be incomplete, wrong, biased and/or prejudiced. I will try my best, and sometimes simply try, but in the best tradition of science I will be very happy to have feedback on much of what I write here -- it may well be even better than the best tradition because it dates back from the 19th century and broad peer- and non-peer-review is only possible now, in 21st century.
The things written here can be broad or specific, philosophical or technical, they may even be incomprehensible to most or all people and serve simply as encouragement for me to elaborate on something that I would otherwise just divagate about inside my head.</p>
