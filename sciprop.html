            <h1>scientific proposal</h1>
            <p>A scientific proposal is not a thing, really, yet, but it will be, maybe. It is a sort of research statement, but it is probably broader and evolving, and may become as big as a book, with all the proper references.</p>
<h3 id="we-like-deterministic-things-but-the-universe-is-stochastic"><em>We like deterministic things, but the universe is stochastic</em></h3>
<p>To paraphrase Daniel Kahneman, unlike the predictable effect of sticking your hand into a live outlet and getting a shock (or in a boolean logic description, a “1”), and then turning of the main switch, doing it again and (provided you did it right) not receiving it (“0”), when you throw a pair of dice a several times you will observe a distribution of outcomes with some being more likely than others – no finger, no electricity, but just as sure a predictable structure, if not a clearly causal outcome.</p>
<p>Because most things we think about are described in deterministic terms, and we are (probably) not as well equipped to deal with probabilistic descriptions, our view of the world reflects the need for certainty, and even the most complex things people have built rely on minimizing error or noise to undetectable levels. That is fine in general, but scientists and technologists should attempt to overcome the limitations of these descriptions. I am certainly not the first person to emphasize the importance of probabilistic models; I am not sure how radical are (or were) the most radical proposals in this direction.</p>
