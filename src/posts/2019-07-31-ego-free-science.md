I used to think that most experimental research was a an unnecessary consumption of Oxygen,  emission of \\( CO_{2} \\), production of trash, and especially a incredible waste of resources. However, I have recently taken on performing a large scale experiment and I have changed my mind -- now I think it is not only that, but it's a huge waste of research effort to achieve those mediocre results.

Of course I am not against experimentation; there is no other way of validating theories, hypotheses, hunches, or psychedelic dreams. But I do think the majority of it is mostly useless. To a large extent, that is the fault of the lack of emphasis on scientific theories and their philosophy, but above all, I would argue that -- as a consequence, or maybe even as the cause -- what is to blame is individualism, or better yet egotism, at the foundation of the scientific enterprise.
