title: "GitHub Pages is -- as far as I am concerned - an amazing platform"

I hope I am not wrong about this, but it seems to me that GitHub Pages just takes away all the nonsense of other blogging platforms like Wordpress or Medium, where they need a business model to monetize what people write.
Of course GitHub has its own business model, but I guess the Pages service only helps them to gain popularity for their paid and enterprise products, being otherwise free (as in you are neither the consumer not the product).

As someone who actually uses GitHub itself very little and does not pay them a dime, it seems that promoting clean, simple, open page hosting is a great public service.
Also for people like me who are not very web-oriented, being able to easily set up page and in the process learn HTML/CSS, Jekyll, Markdown, as well as using GitHub itself routinely ("was it git stage or git add, again?") really seems to go to the (white hat) hacker way of learning about stuff.
I am of course just getting started with this and maybe that is why I am excited about the new shiny objects, but I find that often the hard way of doing things is actually the easiest, so if you ask me (though no one did), I would recommend GitHub Pages over "easier" services any day.  

To those still unconvinced on technical grounds I will also list some link that were helpful to people like me, who otherwise would only be able to write a webpage using Python's `numpy.array` and `scipy.stats`.
