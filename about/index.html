I started doing reseach as an undergrad, using spectroscopy quantum mechanics-based methods to study the luminescence of lanthanide complexes and the structure of biomolecules.
I then moved to the world of public health and epidemiology, but stayed more on the side of using autoregressive models to study time series of disease case notifications then on the practical problems of setting up a refugeee camp, like what happens to all the faeces.

<p>As much as I am concerned about international health and would actually be thrilled to be able to make a difference on the field, I figured my talents were better used in constructing complex models to interpret complex data, which is why I pursued a Ph.D. in (mostly computational) Biology.

I am currently a postdoctoral fellow at a (very) large research institute, and this page exists for some ideas to have a venue, when otherwise they would just remain in my head (in a rather obsessive way). I often found helpful insights in other personal or academic pages and thought I coudl do something similar or stir some discussion about interesting topics.
